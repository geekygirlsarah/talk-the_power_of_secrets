# The Power of Secrets

## Abstract
Secrets can be scary if they get out. That's the very feeling I had when I wrote a Medium post revealing my biggest secret, which was read by thousands.

In this talk, I will share the story of how and why I came to share this secret with the world. I'll also talk about how sharing this ultimately made me a better teammate, developer, and person, and how it had the complete opposite reaction than I expected. Through these experiences, Iâ€™ll share my insights on why being more open benefits you and your team.
